# Jasmine test suite for a web based RSS feedreader

Includes several tests for a RSS feedreader.

Before clicking on index.html and enjoying the app, please make sure you have Karma correctly installed.

All tests should pass for the current features of the website. Included tests for the following future features :

* Add feeds to the feed reader, by inputing a feedname and a feed url. The test validates that a test RSS is correctly added to the end of the feeds;

* Flag feeds, changing their background color to a different green to make them easier to see. The test validates that the flagged feeds are inside the flagged CSS class, and that the background color is a different green.
